# Pokemon API React Rebuild

Created a single page pokemon application using the Pokemonapi and React TypeScript

**Name:** Elizabeth Trotter

**Project Scope:** This project is a single page Pokémon application that fetches data from [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). It is a rebuild of a former project, and this version features `React` and `TypeScript`.

The design was prototyped in `Figma` for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile and the site was made fully responsive with `Tailwind CSS`. 

> [!NOTE]
> This project was pretty interesting! I got to build some cool custom interfaces for the data we were grabbing. It was my first time diving into React with TypeScript, so it was a bit of a learning curve, but I definitely learned a ton!

***Key Features:***

- Ability to get random Pokémon or search by name/ Pokédex number
- Inventory contains Gen 1 - 5 Pokémon and images contain both default & shiny forms
- Info provided for each Pokémon: Name, Element Typing, Location, All Abilities, All Moves, & Evolutionary Paths
- Ability to add to a Favorites list
- Fully Responsive with Tailwind CSS

### Peer Review:

**Name:** Aiden Foo

**Comment(s):**
The site looks good, I like the changing background as well. The only issues are the favorites and the random toggle button at the bottom of the page which breaks the background but that's all easily fixable by the due date. 

**Issue(s) Resolved:**
- [x] Removed random toggle button 3/15 5:25pm
- [x] Fixed favorites functionality 3/16 3:15pm

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
